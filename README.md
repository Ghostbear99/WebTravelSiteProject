# About NodeJS
NodeJS is neither a language or a framework, it is more akin to a runtime engine that allows web pages to be served up from a server. The reason that NodeJS is popular is because it is fast, scalable, and is asynchronous, which means that the program can do other tasks while Node runs.

# Required Software
* NodeJS
* npm (Comes with NodeJS download)
* Visual Studio Enterprise 2017
* Connection.cs
* ASP.NET Core 2.1
* ASP.NET Core 2.2

This project uses WebAPI's and Databases to manage the back-end of this website.
