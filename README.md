# visitUS - a travel booking website.

This project uses WebAPI's and databases to manage the back-end of this website, as well as node.js.


# About NodeJS
NodeJS is neither a language or a framework, it is more akin to a runtime engine that allows web pages to be served up from a server. The reason that NodeJS is popular is because it is fast, scalable, and is asynchronous, which means that the program can do other tasks while Node runs.

# Required Software
* NodeJS
* npm (Comes with NodeJS download)
* Visual Studio Enterprise 2017
* Connection.cs (In DestinationAPI/Models)
* ASP.NET Core 2.1
* ASP.NET Core 2.2


# Here is a complete tutorial on how to navigate node.js and how the website was made.
